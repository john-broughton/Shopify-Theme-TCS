Every gift is wrapped beautifully and prepared for pickup, and your choices can be ordered to have ready in the store for your showers. They offer personalized wines to put on your registry, as well as have in-house cooking classes at a beautiful space (which can also be used for events such as bridal showers), which makes for the perfect break from wedding planning. Every time I walk into the store, I truly feel like I always imagined being a bride would feel like- so very special!\"<\/p>",
